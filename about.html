                <p>I am a coffee drinking coder by day and a coffee drinking gamer by night. I… drink too much coffee.</p>

                Hello! My name is Frank.



                <p>I’m originally from New York. Grew up in queens when I was a kid and then in Lindenhurst when I was a teen. After graduating high school, I decided to join the US Navy as a SONAR Technician. The schooling was at the Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Center in beautiful San Diego, California. After A school, I was stationed on the USS Porter DDG 78 in Norfolk, VA. I did two deployments on that ship. You’d be amazed at what you can find randomly floating in the middle of nowhere. The last deployment had the most action. We came to the aid of a hijacked cargo ship that was over run by pirates, saw some action near Somalia, spoke to some whales using the underwater telephone. So exciting! We ended up crossing the equator and I took part of the line crossing ceremony to become a shellback.

                </p>
                <p>At the age of 12 is when my parents bought their first PC. It was a Hewlett Packard Desktop PC equipped with a CD drive, floppy drive, PS2 mouse and keyboard with a CRT monitor. I remember curious me wanting to crack open the case to see what actually made this thing tick. I’m not going to lie, I was pretty afraid to dig in and get my hands in the computer internals.

                </p>
                <p>Another thing that facinated me on the computer were websites. People had the ability to showcase their artistic abilities on the web. Personal blogs were a huge thing and these bloggers created their own templates and layouts. I just had to know how they did this. To my amazement, you were easily able to view the source code to close to all of the sites found online. So I taught myself. I learned the basics of html and was so excited when I learned how to label the title bar of an internet explorer window. Something that I created. I know its nothing major, but it was huge to me. It was my “hello world” moment.

                </p>
                <p>Videogames are my escape. After a long hard days work of meeting deadlines and finishing up projects, I turn to PC gaming to temporarily escape reality. Nothing beats playing online games with a few friends and having a couple of laughs while capturing the enemy flag. I’m looking at you Apple squad!

                </p>
                <p>When I have down time, you can usually find me online playing some battlefield (battlefield one current;y) If I’m not gaming, I’m usually working on one of my projects. One of many. From time to time I’ll be jamming out while drawing some characters either on paper or on the PC using a wacom tablet. I love reusing old technology and finding alternate uses for them.

                </p>
                <p>I have a degree in computer engineering.</p>
